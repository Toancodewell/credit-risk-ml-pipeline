# credit-risk-ml-pipeline

**Data Cleaning → EDA → Clustering → Machine Learning**

## Overview

This project implements an **end-to-end pipeline** for the **credit risk prediction** task. The main steps include:

1. **Data Cleaning**: handling missing values, removing outliers, normalizing variables  
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: exploring the dataset, visualizing distributions and relationships  
3. **Clustering**: grouping customers or records to discover hidden patterns  
4. **Machine Learning**: building and evaluating models to predict default / credit risk  

The project contains Jupyter notebooks for each step: `Data_cleaning_EDA.ipynb`, `Cluster.ipynb`, `Machine_Learning .ipynb`.
